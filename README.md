Intro to Databases
======================

This material was originally developed by Heather Wade, with Class 1 Data Modeling material adapted from Pamela Fox's one day workshop.

The course is meant to be taught in a four two-hour classes.

## Suggested course description is below:

A database is an organized collection of data. In this class, we will discuss the science (and art) of storing and retrieving data. As anyone who has tried to analyze data using Excel can attest, it is not as simple as it might seem.

Are you a developer (web or otherwise) and wish to learn more about the backend stack? Are you an analyst who would like to learn why your reports take time to build and run? Are you a business owner or hobbyist who'd like to design your own database system? Or, maybe you're thinking about becoming a database professional? If you answered yes to any of the questions above or are just generally interested in learning more about databases - this class will get you started.

This four class course runs on Thursdays:

* Class 1 - Intro to Data Modeling
* Class 2 - Intro to SQL, Reading Data
* Class 3 - Creating, Reading and Updating Tables
* Class 4 - Joins and Advanced Topics

At this time, you will need to provide your own laptop - PC or Mac - to participate in the course.
